Hi!

The main purpose of this repository is keeping code for my future web-service :D.

I want to make my scripts transparent and understandable for everybody :D.

What you can find here?

main.py - Administration module which is ,,decision" script. Here are conducted the most important actions.
worker.py - You have to understand this script as employee who live 24/7 and check amazon price every 1 hour (For you everything my dear.).
worker_creator.py - Here some functionalities to make code more ,,reusable" - something like that. Just module, which creates our workers.
file_reader.py - Important script which delivers functionalities which applies to reading json and csv files.
journalist.py - Main web scrapper script/ msg sender script.
test_sample.py - Some of my tests (main purpose is to check how pytest works).

Test.csv and Test.json are files used in test_sample.py and their purpose is to show, how data structure should looks like.
